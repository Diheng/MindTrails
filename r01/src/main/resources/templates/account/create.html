                <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new, experimental program to
                    encourage healthy thinking about the future. It includes 4 20-minute sessions, completed over
                    the course of 2 weeks (2 sessions per week), and 3 15-minute assessment sessions.
                </p>


                <p> You will be presented with one of a few different training programs. We are testing which
                    programs most effectively encourage healthy thinking about the future. Although our prediction
                    of which program will be most effective is based on previous work in the laboratory, we cannot
                    be sure until the programs are compared by randomly assigning people to each one and then
                    testing the effects. If you get randomly assigned to a program that we do not think will be the
                    strongest one, you will then have the opportunity to complete the program we expect to be most
                    effective after you finish the study. In other words, EVERYBODY gets a chance to try program we
                    expect to be most effective eventually.
                </p>

                <p>You will be asked to complete a 15-minute assessment before your 1st training session, after your
                    4th training session, and 1 month after your 4th training session. The assessments will help us
                    track your progress and determine if this new program is effective.
                </p>

                <p> You will be asked to complete questionnaires in which you describe your thoughts and mood,
                    describe your background and personal mental health history, and you will be asked to complete a
                    task in which you read brief stories, answer questions, and complete word fragments. For some
                    participants, being asked questions about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily
                    distressing.
                </p>

                <p> At the end of the study, you will receive more detail about the studyâ€™s rationale and design.
                    You will also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program and how your
                    thinking about the future changed.
                </p>

                <p> There may be no direct benefits to you. Depending on your randomly assigned conditioning, you may
                    complete procedures that may help encourage healthy thinking about the future.
                </p>
